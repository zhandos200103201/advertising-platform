Report 1.
In these weeks firstly we decide to learn basic structures and syntaxis of Go with documentation,
and book "Learning Go Programming" by Vladimir Vivien. As this book is too large to read in one
week, we have divided the book into 3 parts. First 4 chapters are given to Zhiger, middle
is given to Nursultan, last chapters to Zhandos. Then we shared our knowledge to each other.
So we needed fundamental knowledge in order to create a good project instead of just copying some
tutorials.

Mysql server was connected by Nurs.

Note: You need to restart everytime after changing the code

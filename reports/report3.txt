Report 3
First we created a form for Sign up and Sign in. Then from these forms we chose variables more precisely inputs.
And then we checked them before sending them to the database.

During authorization, we will select a password and hash it, if it matches the hashing in the database, we will display on the screen,
(for example: Hello,Nurs),and if it does not match, it will give an error.

We made the design for the forms using bootstrap.
